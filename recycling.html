	<h1> Recycling</h1>
	 <p>You have probably heard of it before, but do you actually know what recycling is?
	    Recycling is the breakdown of waste into new materials. This is good for the environment because it means that less new plastic needs to be produced
		because more old plastics are being recycled. Everyone can recycle, and this is why it is so important that people understand the impact of
		simply putting a plastic bottle into a recycling bin.</p>

	<h2>How does recycling stop this issue?</h2>
	 <p>Recycling helps this issue because it means that plastics are reused. This reduces the amount of new plastics that are created and potential for them to be in the ocean. Recycling is a solution that everyone can
	 be involved in, and New Zealand is already actively trying to encourage households to recycle, by providing large recycling bins in big cities. If everyone chips in, and recycles all their recyclable plastic, then in the long run, New
	 Zealand will be cleaner, and marine animals will not suffer as much.</p>
	 <br><br>
	<h2>What else can I do to stop this issue?</h2>
	 <p>There are many things that you can do to help, such as joining beach clean-up movements. Other ways that you can help is by changing some of your products at home. 
	 This can include using reusable bags rather than single use ones, and buying products with less packaging. Other ways, is to stop littering and making sure that the streets are clean, 
	 so there is not a big risk of it blowing into the oceans.</p>
